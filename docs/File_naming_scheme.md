# File naming scheme

Many files are separated out and are in their own directory. Some name are confusing to say the least. <br>
Therefore, I've used a file naming schemes. This primarily is for file prefixes.

## Prefixes

Prefix are characters attached to the beginning of a file name and followed by an underscore.<br>
eg: `d_settings.ts`<br>
Here `d_` is the prefix.<br>

## Types

- `d` - Used to represent data files. ie they store some type of data like configs etc.
- `s` - Used to specify the structure of a data. They are interfaces, enums etc.
- `c` - Used to specify controller classes.
- `h` - To specify handlers to controller classes.
