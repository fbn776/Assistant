# Assistant âœ¨
This is a personal project built using React, Tailwindcss and Typescript. The assistant is a chat bot like application that has a custom terminal like language support for quick assistance. This language has access to many predefined internal functions. The user uses this custom command like language to communicate with the assistant. This language is then parsed and executed and then displays the result as a reply message.<br>
This a hobby project. I also learned typescript while building this, thats a plusðŸ˜Š.
