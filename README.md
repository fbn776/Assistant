# Assistant âœ¨

The Assistant is a personal project for learning and experimenting with `typescript`. The project is a chatbot like application that responds to user given commands. These commands are defined using a custom built instruction language. The commands can be chained together to create more complex instructions. These are then executed by a custom executor, and the results are returned to the user via messages in the chat.

## Usage

The web application is hosted [here](https://assistant-ebon.vercel.app/). Once opened, you can type commands. Currently [^date] there are only a few commands supported.

Eg:
```
add 10 20
```
Outputs 30

  NOTE: More documentation is needed
