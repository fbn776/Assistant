# Assistant âœ¨

The Assistant is a personal project for learning and experimenting with `typescript`. The project is a chatbot like application that responds to user given commands. These commands are defined using a custom built instruction language. The commands can be chained together to create more complex instructions. These are then executed by a custom executor, and the results are returned to the user via messages in the chat.
